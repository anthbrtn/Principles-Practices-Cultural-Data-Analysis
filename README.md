**Academic Year**: 2025-2026

**Course catalogue number**: 158621186Y

**Lecturer**: Anthony Burton (a.g.burton@uva.nl)

## Getting Started

The practical assignments for this course require that each student is able to run Python code as well as view and interact with Jupyter Notebooks. To facilitate this, we will make use of Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/

To open the course material in Colab, first navigate to the correct folder for the week on Github. For instance, for the first week this is [https://github.com/CANAL-amsterdam/Foundations-of-Cultural-and-Social-Data-Analysis/tree/main/01-introduction-cook-books](here) . The folder for each week contains a `[week]_chapter.ipynb` and a `[week]_exercises.ipynb` file. Open these in a new window, and press the `Open in Colab` button at the top of the file.

:exclamation: Before doing anything in the notebook, it is best to save a copy to your own Google Drive. You can do this by pressing the `Copy to Drive` button at the top of the Colab page, or by going to `File > Save a copy in drive`.

The chapter file contains that week's chapter from the [Humanities Data Analysis](https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org/) book, prepared as a notebook so you can experiment and play with the examples. The exercises file contains the exercises for that chapter. For each week's assignment you are expected to work in this file and complete the exercises.

Once you have completed the assignment, you can in Colab navigate to `File > Download > Download .ipynb` to download the file you will need to submit on Canvas.
